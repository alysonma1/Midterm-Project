# Midterm-Project
I will be examining some statistical methodologies commonly used in the criminal justice system as well as their moral justification, particularly focusing on predictive policing and risk assessment. With the guidance of the journal "Artificial Intelligence, Predictive Policing, and Risk Assessment for Law Enforcement" written by Richard A. Berk, a professor in the Department of Statistics and Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, I will discuss various statistical modeling techniques commonly used in predictive policing such as Euclidean Distance, Bayesian approaches, and point process models and in risk assessment such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests.
